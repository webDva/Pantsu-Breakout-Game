# Pantsu-Breakout-Game
Phaser web game

You can play the latest viable product number on my [itch.io](https://hollowsouls.itch.io/pantsu-breakout-game) or the [GitHub Pages](https://windows146.github.io/Pantsu-Breakout-Game/public_html/).

It's kinda mobile-friendly, but at the cost of being desktop-unfriendly.

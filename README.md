# Pantsu-Breakout-Game
Phaser web game

You can play the latest minimum viable product on my [itch.io](https://hollowsouls.itch.io/pantsu-breakout-game) or the latest version on the [GitHub Pages](https://windows146.github.io/Pantsu-Breakout-Game/public_html/).

I messed up with using variables, creating global ones instead of local ones inside a Game state object as I wanted. So, since I don't want to refactor all that stuff that's currently written, I'll stop development of Pantsu Breakout Game and just leave it at minimum viable product number five.
